##

* 5V - This is 5v out from the USB port. You can also use this as a voltage input but you must have some sort of diode (schottky, signal, power) between your external power source and this pin with anode to battery, cathode to 5V pin.
* 3V3 - This is the regulated output from the onboard regulator. You can draw 700mA
* GND - Power/data/signal ground
