# XIAO ESP32S3-Sense Image Classification üê∂üê±

Here we are going to build a tinyML project with XIAO ESP32S3-Sense to classify Dog and Cat in photo. Let's get started.

## How it's working

We are running the machine learning model on our XIAO and feeding camera stream to it. Then the XIAO inference the result and predict with the help on onboard neiral network we implimented on. Let's build one.
