# Introduction to Edge Impulse ðŸ’ª

Edge Impulse is the leading development platform for machine learning on edge devices, free for developers, and trusted by enterprises worldwide.

* With Edge Impulse, software developers, engineers, and domain experts can solve real problems using machine learning on edge devices without a Ph.D. or advanced embedded engineering skills. From getting started to MLOps in production, Edge Impulse provides maximum efficiency and speed on a wide range of hardware from MCUs to CPUs.

With EdgeImpulse we can

* Collect dataset from the device direclty
* Collect dataset from other source like .zip file, via api or other third party cloud ingestion
* Create test and train data and put them in different lables
* Train our model
* Able to Select approriate ML algoirthms - EI provide recommended ML algorithms based on our dataset
* Deploy it on our harware
* TinyML project collabration with version controlling
* and much more that helps you to build tinyML applications.

### Why we use edge impulse

We use edge impulse to collect the data, create model, and train using the ML algorithms. It's free and easy to use and it will be generate arduino library so that we can quickly start with prototyping.
