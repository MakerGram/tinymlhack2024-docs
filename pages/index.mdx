# Introduction

Welcome to [tinyml hackathon](http://tinymlhack.com/) documentation.

## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is a collaborative event where developers, designers, engineers, and enthusiasts come together to create innovative projects within a limited timeframe. Participants work in teams to brainstorm, prototype, and build solutions, often centered around a specific theme or technology.

## What is tinyML Hackathon?

tinyML Hackathon focuses on the exciting field of Tiny Machine Learning (tinyML), which involves deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices. This hackathon challenges participants to explore the power of AI and IoT by building intelligent applications on low-power, edge-based hardware like XIAO boards and similar platforms.

## What Will Be Happening Here?

During this hackathon, participants will:

* Collaborate in teams to solve real-world problems using tinyML.

* Gain hands-on experience with tools like Edge Impulse and tinyML-compatible boards like XIAO ESP32S3 Sense and more. .

* Access expert guidance and resources to refine their projects.

* Compete for exciting prizes, including tinyML kits and cash rewards.
