# Seeed XIAO nRF52840 Sense

Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 is equipped with a powerful Nordic nRF52840 MCU which integrates Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. Meanwhile, it has a small and exquisite form-factor which can be used for wearable devices and Internet of Things projects. The single-sided surface-mountable design and the onboard Bluetooth antenna can greatly facilitate the rapid deployment of IoT projects.

## Two Arduino Libraries

Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840 assembles many functions in one tiny board and sometimes may not perform the best of them. Hence, Seeed has published two Arduino libraries to let it maximum the power of each function. Therefore:

*  It is recommanded to use the Seeed nRF52 Boards library if you want to apply Bluetooth function and "Low Energy Cost Function".
* It is recommanded to use the Seeed nRF52 mbed-enabled Boards library if you want to use it in embedded Machine Learning Applications or apply "IMU & PDM advanced function".
* Both libraries support very well when it comes to the basic usage, such as LED, Digital, Analog, Serial, I2C, SPI.
