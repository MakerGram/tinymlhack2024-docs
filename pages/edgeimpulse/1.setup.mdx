##### If you are using XIAO nRF52840 Sense

#### Step 2: 📍 Install Edge impulse CLI for data ingestion

This Edge Impulse CLI is used to control local devices, act as a proxy to synchronise data for devices that don't have an internet connection, and to upload and convert local files. The CLI consists of seven tools:


* [edge-impulse-daemon](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-daemon) - configures devices over serial, and acts as a proxy for devices that do not have an IP connection.
* [edge-impulse-uploader](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-uploader) - allows uploading and signing local files.
* [edge-impulse-data-forwarder](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-data-forwarder) - a very easy way to collect data from any device over a serial connection, and forward the data to Edge Impulse.
* [edge-impulse-run-impulse](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-run-impulse) - show the impulse running on your device.
* [edge-impulse-blocks](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/cli-blocks) - create organizational transformation, custom dsp, custom deployment and custom transfer learning blocks.
* [himax-flash-tool](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-cli/himax-flash-tool) - to flash the Himax WE-I Plus


### Installation - Windows
1. Create an [Edge Impulse account](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup).
2. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) on your host computer.
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or higher on your host computer.
    * For Windows users, install the Additional Node.js tools (called Tools for Native Modules on newer versions) when prompted.
4. Install the CLI tools via:
    ``npm install -g edge-impulse-cli --force``

You should now have the tools available in your PATH.

### Installation - Linux, Ubuntu, MacOS, and Raspbian OS

1. Create an [Edge Impulse account](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/signup).
2. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) on your host computer.
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or higher on your host computer.
Alternatively, run the following commands:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
node -v
```
The last command should return the node version, v14 or above.
Let's verify the node installation directory:
``npm config get prefix``
If it returns /usr/local/, run the following commands to change npm's default directory:
```
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.profile
```
On MacOS you might be using zsh as default, so you will want to update the correct profile
```
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zprofile
```
4. Install the CLI tools via:
``npm install -g edge-impulse-cli``
You should now have the tools available in your PATH.
