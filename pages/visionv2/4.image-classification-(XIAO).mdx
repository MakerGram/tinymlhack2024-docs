Grove Vision AI uses WiseEye2 HX6538 chip, image processing and model inference are processed locally in Grove Vision AI, and then the result is output to XIAO via IIC or UART, so the main purpose of this library is to process the data stream of Grove Vision AI, and it doesn't involve model inference or image processing. So the main purpose of this library is to process the data stream of Grove Vision AI, without involving model inference or image processing.

The Grove Vision AI communicates with the XIAO via the IIC, and the device's IIC address is 0x62. Image information transfer is via the USB serial port.
