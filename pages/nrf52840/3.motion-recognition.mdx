# Motion Recognition using XIAO nRF52840 Sense ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ

The Magic Wand project is a fascinating application of TinyML where you can use machine learning to recognize hand-drawn gestures such as letters or shapes. By utilizing onboard sensors like an accelerometer and a gyroscope, this project demonstrates how to train and deploy a model capable of detecting specific patterns. It's an ideal introduction to the world of embedded machine learning and gesture-based applications.
