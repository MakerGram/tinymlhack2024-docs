## Project Description

An intelligent and compact solution leveraging Tiny ML to detect, predict, and mitigate stampedes, ensuring public safety through real-time monitoring and analysis

##  The Problem

Stampedes in crowded areas often result in chaos, injuries, and fatalities, primarily due to the lack of real-time monitoring and effective crowd management solutions. Traditional methods are either slow, resource-intensive, or incapable of predicting such incidents proactively.

## The Solution

We solved this problem by implementing a Machine learning model on a TinyML component named Grove vision AI Module V2.

This AI model utilizes the advanced  Swift-YOLO algorithm, focusing on person recognition, and can accurately detect and tag individuals in real-time video streams. It is particularly suited for the SeeedStudio Grove Vision AI (V2) device, offering high compatibility and stability

## Technical Details

###  Technologies/Components Used
#### For Software:
* Python - pyserial
* Arduino IDE
* Seeed Arduino SSCMA Library
* Pre-trained AI Model ([Model Detail - - SenseCraft AI](https://sensecraft.seeed.cc/ai/#/model/detail?id=60242&tab=public))
#### For Hardware:
* Grove Vision AI Module V2
* Seeed ESP32S3


## Implementation

* Plug and connect Grove Vision AI Module V2 to sense craft (Person Detection Model)
* Download and install Seeed-Arduino-SSCMA Library from github ([GitHub](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Arduino_SSCMA/))
* Add Library to Arduino IDE and include the header file
* Connect ESP32S3 module with Grove Vision AI Module V2
* Write a program to extract the person count and compare with the limit.
* Add WIFI header file to utilize the WIFI functionality of ESP32S3 ("WiFi.h")
* Add HTTPClient header file to make HTTP requests ("HTTPClient.h")
* Implement Telegram notification system to Alert the organisers.
* Write python code using pyserial to read the data from Module for further data analysis.
* The collected data is uploaded to google sheet and graphs are created.
